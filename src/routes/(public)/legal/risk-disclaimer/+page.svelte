	<h1>Risk Disclaimer</h1>

	<p><b>Last Updated:</b> September 11, 2025</p>

	<p>
		Trading financial instruments involves substantial risk and may not be suitable for all
		investors. Before deciding to trade on the TradeXcope platform, you should carefully consider your
		investment objectives, level of experience, risk tolerance, and seek advice from an independent
		financial advisor if you have any doubts.
	</p>

	<h2>1. High Risk Investment Warning</h2>

	<p>
		Trading binary options, digital contracts, forex, commodities, indices, and cryptocurrencies
		involves significant risk of loss and is not appropriate for all investors. The highly leveraged
		nature of these products means that small market movements may have a disproportionately large
		impact on the funds you have deposited or will be required to deposit. This can work against you
		as well as for you. You may sustain a total loss of your initial margin funds and may be
		required to deposit additional funds to maintain your position. If you fail to provide the
		required additional funds within the time required, your position may be liquidated at a loss,
		and you will be liable for any resulting deficit in your account.
	</p>

	<h2>2. No Guarantee of Profit</h2>

	<p>
		Past performance of financial instruments is not indicative of future results. There is no
		guarantee that you will earn any profit, and you accept the risk that the value of your
		investments may go down as well as up. You acknowledge that losses can exceed your initial
		investment depending on the product traded and market conditions.
	</p>

	<h2>3. Market Volatility and Liquidity Risk</h2>

	<p>
		Financial markets can be extremely volatile. Prices can move rapidly in response to news,
		economic data, geopolitical events, or market sentiment. During periods of high volatility or
		low liquidity, you may experience slippage, delayed execution, or inability to enter or exit
		positions at desired prices. TradeXcope is not responsible for losses incurred due to market
		conditions beyond its control.
	</p>

	<h2>4. Platform and Technical Risk</h2>

	<p>
		While TradeXcope strives to maintain a reliable and secure trading platform, you acknowledge that
		technical failures can occur. These include, but are not limited to:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Internet connectivity issues or outages;</li>
		<li>Platform or server downtime;</li>
		<li>Delays in price feeds or execution;</li>
		<li>Errors in trade processing or settlement;</li>
		<li>Security breaches or cyberattacks.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		TradeXcope shall not be liable for any losses resulting from such technical failures, whether
		caused by us, third-party providers, or force majeure events.
	</p>

	<h2>5. Regulatory and Jurisdictional Risk</h2>

	<p>
		TradeXcope operates under the laws and regulations of the Cayman Islands. The regulatory
		environment may differ significantly from your country of residence. You are responsible for
		ensuring that your use of the TradeXcope platform complies with all applicable laws and
		regulations in your jurisdiction. Some countries prohibit or restrict online trading — it is
		your responsibility to know and abide by these rules.
	</p>

	<h2>6. Leverage Risk</h2>

	<p>
		Leverage magnifies both gains and losses. While it allows you to control large positions with
		relatively small capital, it also increases your exposure to potential losses. You may lose more
		than your initial deposit when trading leveraged products. You should never trade with money you
		cannot afford to lose.
	</p>

	<h2>7. Counterparty Risk</h2>

	<p>
		When you trade on TradeXcope, you are entering into a contract with us as your counterparty. You
		are exposed to the risk that TradeXcope may be unable or unwilling to fulfill its obligations
		under the contract. While we maintain strict financial controls and risk management procedures,
		no system is entirely immune to failure.
	</p>

	<h2>8. No Fiduciary Duty</h2>

	<p>
		TradeXcope does not act as your financial advisor, broker, or fiduciary. All information provided
		on the platform — including market analysis, signals, educational content, and trading ideas —
		is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as investment advice. You are
		solely responsible for your trading decisions.
	</p>

	<h2>9. Tax and Legal Responsibility</h2>

	<p>
		You are solely responsible for reporting and paying any taxes, duties, or levies arising from
		your trading activities. TradeXcope does not provide tax, legal, or accounting advice. Consult
		your own professional advisors regarding the tax implications of your trades in your
		jurisdiction.
	</p>

	<h2>10. Self-Exclusion and Responsible Trading</h2>

	<p>
		Trading can be addictive and emotionally taxing. If you feel you are losing control or trading
		compulsively, you should stop immediately and seek professional help. TradeXcope offers
		self-exclusion tools and deposit limits to help you manage your risk. Please use them
		responsibly.
	</p>

	<h2>11. Educational Content Disclaimer</h2>

	<p>
		Any educational materials, webinars, tutorials, or market commentary provided by TradeXcope are
		general in nature and do not take into account your personal financial situation or objectives.
		They are not tailored advice and should not be relied upon as a basis for making trading
		decisions.
	</p>

	<h2>12. Third-Party Content and Links</h2>

	<p>
		TradeXcope may provide links to third-party websites or integrate third-party content (e.g., news
		feeds, economic calendars). We do not endorse or assume responsibility for the accuracy,
		legality, or content of any third-party sites or materials. Use them at your own risk.
	</p>

		<b>WARNING:</b> DO NOT TRADE WITH MONEY YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE. TRADING IS NOT A “GET RICH QUICK”
		SCHEME. IT REQUIRES SKILL, DISCIPLINE, AND RISK MANAGEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT FULLY UNDERSTAND THE RISKS,
		DO NOT TRADE.
